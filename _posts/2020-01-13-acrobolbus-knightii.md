*Acrobolbus knightii* was described by William Mitten in 1867 (as Marsupidium knightii Mitt.) from a specimen collected in New Zealand by Charles Knight. It grows on tree trunks and branches and on rotting logs, often in extensive mats, and less commonly on soil.

The leaves are roundly oblong to quadrate, concave, pale green, rarely more than 1.5 mm long, arranged in two ranks and inserted succubously. They are commonly angled upwards towards the shoot tip and overlapping, so that the stem is hidden. The leaf margins are strongly toothed and the teeth are often elongated into spines or cilia. Microscopically the leaf cells are mostly hexagonal, with thin walls and very small trigones. The cells are opaque because of the presence  of numerous brownish oil bodies. The capsule develops in a marsupium on a short branch, and the marsupia are usually in pairs.

*Acrobolbus knightii* is common throughout New Zealand, including the Chatham Islands and Raoul Island in the Kermadecs. The range extends to Australia (New South Wales and northern Queensland) and New Caledonia.
