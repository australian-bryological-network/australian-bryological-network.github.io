This extremely rare moss inhabits pools and boggy sites in the treeless zone of the south-eastern Alps. At present it is known in Australia only from a few scattered sites on the Bogong High Plains in Victoria and in Kosciuszko National Park, New South Wales.

When it was first discovered in Australia by George Scott and Bruce Fuhrer in 1986, near Mount Nelse in Victoria, *Bartramia subsymmetrica* was thought to be a new species and was named *Bartramia bogongia* by David Catcheside. However, Fransén (2004) concluded that *B. bogongia* was the same as *B. subsymmetrica*, which had been described from specimens collected at Cumberland Bay on the island of South Georgia by Skottsberg in 1902. *Bartramia abbreviata* Cardot & Broth. and *Exodokidium subsymmetricum* (Cardot) Cardot are other synonyms. Matteri (1984) mistakenly considered *B. subsymmetrica* to be the same as *B. patens* var. *robusta* (Hook.f. & Wilson) Matteri (= *B. robusta* Hook.f. & Wilson).

_Bartramia subsymmetrica_ is distinguished by its very long stems (up to 10 cm in Australian specimens), lack of subfloral innovations, leaves mostly 2–3 cells thick and with a sheathing hyaline base, laminal cells mostly elongate, and (in Australia) its wholly aquatic or semi-aquatic alpine habitat.

_Bartramia subsymmetrica_ is listed as threatened in Victoria under the *Flora and Fauna Guarantee Act 1988* and should be proposed for listing as threatened nationally. Current threats include trampling of habitat by feral deer and horses, and a reduction in habitat caused by climate-driven changes in hydrology.
