## Northern Rivers, New South Wales, 23–28 September 2018

The XIVth Australian Bryophyte Workshop will be held between
the 23rd until the 28th of September 2018. The workshop will be based in the picturesque Northern
Rivers region of the New South Wales (NSW) and a number of sites and ecosystems within the
former Big Scrub area will be available for collecting. The area is in the Macleay–McPherson Overlap
where temperate and tropical species converge, so the bryophyte flora is exceedingly rich and
interesting.

Reverend William Walter Watts (1856–1920) was one of New South Wales's greatest authorities on
bryophytes. He collected prodigiously while he was based at Ballina in northern NSW as minister at
the Presbyterian Church (1896-1903) and collected over 4000 bryophyte specimens. The workshop
will commemorate Watts’ pioneering spirit since it is almost a century since his passing.

### Workshop accommodation

Accommodation will be in shared facilities at Dorroughby Environmental Education Centre (DEEC),
which is conveniently located in proximity to a number of National Parks, approximately 20 minutes
north-east of Lismore. The DEEC provides shared dormitory facilities with camping areas also
available. Each dormitory sleeps 18.

### Field trips and collecting

There will be daily field trips to a variety of ecosystems, including remnants of the Big Scrub (lowland
subtropical rainforest) and wet and dry sclerophyll forest. Proposed collecting sites will include
Nightcap Ranges NP, Mount Jerusalem NP, Border Ranges, Mooball NP, Mebbin NP, Whian Whian
State Conservation Area and possibly Wollumbin NP.
